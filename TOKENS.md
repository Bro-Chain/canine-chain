# Canine Chain Tokens
## Contents
1. [JKL](#jkl)
2. [JWL](#jwl)

## JKL
JKL, or Jackal, is the native token on the canine chain. JKL is used to pay gas, incentivize validators & miners, vote on governance proposals and pay for storage space.

## JWL
JWL, or Jewel, is a store-of-value token native to the Canine Blockchain. JWL tokens are immutable, meaning they can never be created, changed or destroyed. There is a finite amount of JWL that will be minted at the chains genesis and then never again. These tokens are not stable and act just as any other speculative token does.
### Purpose
The purpose of the JWL token is to act as a store-of-value on the network. Because JKL tokens act as payment, miner rewards, and validator incentives--there is an inflationary mechanism underlying that token. As such, the value of one JKL token will be less than what it was a year ago (not accounting for price fluctuations external to inflation). This makes JKL a poor store-of-value: it is inherently inflationary. Bitcoin for example is a "good" store-of-value as the amount of Bitcoin in circulation is close to constant. The issue is that Bitcoin is also the native currency on the Bitcoin network. This means Bitcoin is used as gas as well as being the payment token. JWL on the other hand is a secondary token to JKL. This mean you transfer JWL on the canine network using JKL as gas. This keeps the value of JWL constant across the network at all times.
